based on Kuyper 1991

Introduction

> 1\. Read the statement of purpose at the end of the introduction. What
> was the objective of the study?
>
> 2\. Consider the title. Does it precisely state the subject of the paper?
>
> 3\. Read the statement of purpose in the abstract. Does it match that in
> the introduction?
>
> 4\. Check the sequence of statements in the introduction. Does all
> information lead directly to the purpose of the study?

Methods

> 5\. Review all methods in relation to the objective of the study. Are the
> methods valid for studying this problem?
>
> 6\. Check the methods for essential information. Could the study be
> duplicated from the information given?
>
> 7\. Review the methods for possible fatal flaws. Is the sample selection
> adequate? Is the experimental design appropriate?
>
> 8\. Check the sequence of statements in the methods. Does all information
> belong in the methods? Can the methods be subdivided for greater
> clarity?

Results

> 9\. Scrutinize the data, as presented in tables and illustrations. Does
> the title or legend accurately describe content? Are column headings and
> labels accurate? Are the data organized for ready comparison and
> interpretation?
>
> 10\. Review the results as presented in the text while referring to data
> in the tables and illustrations. Does the text complement, and not
> simply repeat, data? Are there discrepancies in results between text and
> tables?
>
> 11\. Check all calculations and presentation of data.
>
> 12\. Review the results in the light of the stated objective. Does the
> study reveal what the researcher intended?

Discussion

> 13\. Check the interpretation against the results. Does the discussion
> merely repeat the results? Does the interpretation arise logically from
> the data, or is too far-fetched? Have shortcomings of the research been
> addressed?
>
> 14\. Compare the interpretation to related studies cited in the article.
> Is the interpretation at odds or in line with other researchers’
> thinking?
>
> 15\. Consider the published research on this topic. Have all key studies
> been considered?
>
> 16\. Reflect on directions for future research. Has the author suggested
> further work?

Overview

> 17\. Consider the journal for which the article is intended. Are the
> topic and format appropriate for that journal?
>
> 18\. Reread the abstract. Does it accurately summarize the article?
>
> 19\. Check the structure of the article (first headings and then
> paragraphing). Is all material organized under the appropriate heading?
> Are sections subdivided logically into subsections or paragraphs?
>
> 20\. Reflect on the author’s thinking and writing style. Does the author
> present this research logically and clearly?

**Other Writing Tips**

These are based on Steven Pinker’s book, “Sense of Style”.

The overarching idea: A writer, in conversation with a reader, directs
the reader’s gaze to something in the world (pg 56).

**Writing Grants, with a focus on the DDIG**

The first paragraph should be its own little abstract. The writer should
say, ‘Here’s this problem, this is why it’s important and important,
this is how I’m going to go about answering it’ within three or four
sentences.

Some notes on a meeting with Molly about writing DDIGs:

Something to think about:

“In considering the appropriateness of any proposed experimental design,
it is always needful to forecast all possible results of the experiment,
and to have decided without ambiguity what interpretation shall be
placed upon each one of them.” - R. A. Fisher, *The Design of
Experiments*

**Politics and the English Language, George Orwell**

**Style: towards clarity and grace. Joseph Williams**

Writing sentences

\(1) The subjects of sentences should be the cast of characters, and (2)
verbs (not nouns) that go along with those subjects name the actions.
Don’t use a verb to simply state that an action exists—tell the reader
what the subject is doing. p. 21

Using these two simple rules, in general, results in sentences that have
better flow, are shorter, more concrete, etc.

**Some critiques of sentences:**

“Adjusted R-squared were, however, found maximal with hair methylation
levels (adjusted R-squared - 0.620-0.785 depending on the coverage
threshold considered). — Pedersen et al. 2014 Genome Research

“Understanding the genetic basis of speciation is a major goal of
evolutionary biology. However, identifying the loci responsible for
reproductive isolation using linkage mapping is a challenging task, and
only a handful of genes have been directly implicated in either
prezygotic isolation…” —doi: 10.1111/mec.12796

This is first sentence of a paper. It starts with a really boring,
vanilla sentence that adds nothing to the paper. The second sentence
goes right into linkage mapping…what the fuck? What is the connection
between speciation and linkage mapping? They also start talking about
reproductive isolation without reminding the reader that reproductive
isolation is the basis of speciation.![](media/image1.png)

The sentence that starts with “A long-standing question…” sets up two
alternative hypotheses. The next sentence should really tell us how we
can differentiate between these two alternatives. The potential to use
parallel structure between the two sentences is also great.
Unfortunately, the authors totally blow it. The second sentence requires
further abstraction by the reader (“if OB is evolving clonally…that
means…what?”), and doesn’t say *how* we can use FST to differentiate
between the two hypotheses, just that we *can* use it.

“In a recently reported study, face and non-face distractor images were
briefly flashed in the periphery while monkeys made eye movements to
targets in order to receive fluid reward.”

Was it a recent study, or was the study simply reported (e.g. by the
news) recently? The authors attempt to summarize an experimental design
in one sentence, but leave a lot unanswered: they made eye movements to
targets? what is a target? And worst of all: what the hell is a fluid
reward? Why not just say juice?

“Both species were observed in a discrimination between two black
geometric figures in a white background (filled triangle vs. empty
circle).”

Observed in a discrimination? Why would you say something abstract (two
black geometric figures in a white background—also, doesn’t you mean
*on* a white background?) and then follow it by something concrete that
actually makes sense?
